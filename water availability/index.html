          <h2>Water Conservation Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth</li>
            <li>Fix leaks promptly</li>
            <li>Use a broom instead of a hose to clean outdoor areas</li>
            <li>
              Water your lawn and plants in the early morning or late evening to
              reduce evaporation
            </li>

            <li>
              Maximize the use of natural vegetation and establish smaller
              lawns. For portions of your lot where a lawn and landscaping are
              desired, ask your local nursery for tips about plants and grasses
              with low water demand (such as creeping fescue).<span id="dots"
                >...</span
              ><span id="more"
                >Consider planting more trees, shrubs, ground covers, and less
                grass. Shrubs and ground covers provide greenery for much of the
                year and usually demand less water. Use native plants in flower
                beds. Native plants have adapted to rainfall conditions in New
                England and often provide good wildlife habitat. Cluster plants
                that require extra care together to minimize time and save
                water.

          <h3>&nbsp Water and the climate crisis: 10 things you should know</h3>
          <p class="text-small">
            The world needs to get water smart. Everyone has a role to play, and
            we cannot afford to wait. Climate change is disrupting weather
            patterns, leading to extreme weather events, unpredictable water
            availability, exacerbating water scarcity and contaminating water
            supplies. Such impacts can drastically affect the quantity and
            quality of water that children need to survive.

          <h3>&nbsp Attacks on water and sanitation infrastructure</h3>
          <p class="text-small">
            This includes both intentional attacks, such as targeting pipelines
            or pouring concrete into wells, and inadvertent attacks, where
            reckless bombardment with no attempt to avoid critical civilian
            infrastructure results in damaged or destroyed water and sanitation
            systems.

          <p class="text-small">
            8 out of 10 people who lack even basic drinking water live in rural
            areas. Two-thirds of people who lack even basic sanitation live in
            rural areas. 9 out of 10 people who practice open defecation live in
            rural areas.

        <p id="p">
          One of the most pressing national and global issues is the
          availability of freshwater due to global climate change, energy
          scarcity issues and the increase in world population and accompanying
          economic growth. Estimates of water supplies and flows through the
          world's hydrologic cycle and their spatiotemporal variability indicate
          an impending world crisis. Increasing use of water due to population
          and associated economic growth pressures, are creating water shortages
          in many parts of the U.S. that are projected to have population
          increases in the next 25 years. Scarcity of energy resources results
          in the increasing use of alternative fuels, some of which require
          enormous water withdrawals for fuel processing. Increasing regional
          and global temperatures is causing loss of freshwater supplies due to
          increased evapotranspiration and reduced recharge of underground
          drinking water supplies. Agriculture is the dominant component of
          human water use, accounting for almost 70% of all water withdrawals.
          Many factors significantly impact increasing water demand in Oklahoma,
          including population growth, economic growth, technological
          development, land use and urbanization, rate of environmental
          degradation, government programs, climate change, and others. Water
          demand management is the realistic way forward. Climate change adds
          further risks and uncertainties to the picture requiring the adoption
          of adaptive management strategies for water resource sustainability.
          Sustainable development is defined as the use of ground water and
          surface water in a manner that can be maintained for an indefinite
          time without causing unacceptable environmental, economic, or social
          consequences.
